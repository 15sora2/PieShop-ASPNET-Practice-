****Creating a new application****
-->wwwroot folder: how does it work?
	-->www.sitename.com\image\image1.jpg
	-->wwwroot\images\image1.jpg
		-->Imagine there's an images folder in wwwroot
		-->When we put an image into the page, the compiler will
			map wwwroot to the website root (in this case it's sitename.com)
			to create the proper path to the image.
